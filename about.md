Hi. I'm a graphic designer and web designer/developer living in Cincinnati, OH. Development for the web and graphic arts are my first passion. How design can be combined with technology to provide unique and inspiring user interactions is my second passion. My personal goal is to contribute to the already amazing community of designers and developers by pushing the boundaries of our digital capabilities.

## My History

Orignally, my plan was to go into fine arts. Making it as a painter or draftsmen would have been incredible. Slowly, I beagn to find inspiration in areas outside of fine artsâ€”namely typography and mid-twentieth century European design. When I began studying graphic design, I was not as comfortable as I was in fine arts so finding inspiration in even a few small areas of the graphic arts was incredibly refreshing. This inspiration would help lead me to develop an appreciation for all that graphic design has to offer.

### Typography

My love for typography grew fast, and without apology. I can safely say my first recognition of the uniqueness of type came from DIN, when I saw how the letterforms varied from those I was used to seeing every time I popped open Illustrator or Word. How intentional the negative space both in the counterforms and the spacing between letters, how tall and refined the shapes were. How cohesive the style was no matter which weight you chose. I fell in love the blending of engineering and artistry that must have gone into making such a wonderful typeface. I've been hooked ever since.

After this discovery and after a few projects centered around DIN, I looked around for more. I investigated the characteristics of different type styles and how classifications of serifs and sans-serifs worked. I played with old-fashioned figures and monospaced figures and everything else across the board. Still, I kept coming back to a few favorites.

### Development

The clarity of intent and the requirement for a cohesive system found within typography was something I also found in development. In my opinion, the two have more in common than is typically recognized.
