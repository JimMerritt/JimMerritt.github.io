This is the first Jekyll site I've built. There are several reasons I decided to go for Jekyll, but one of the primary ones was how many different technologies are involved in the process of developing a Jekyll site.<!-- more --> By default, I have access to git, github, sass, markdown, liquid templating, and plenty more I can plug in. Having all of these available by default is amazing. I know how to use each, but building this site will allow me to get better at each.

## Static Site
Having built quite a few sites in PHP with database access and security and all thoseother headaches, Jekyll will be a great relief to work since:   

* I am the only one developing so I don't have to worry about scalability
* I can develop everything locally, easily and push the static files directly to Github to publish
* I don't have to mess with security or databases or configuring live vs. local or anything like that

Building a static site locally and having an easy process to push live is an incredible change. I understand this workflow cannot work for every site and there are a ton of great cases for a CMS tied to a database giving a full team access to content development. Luckily for me, this isn't one of those times!

## Full Control
All of the customization capabilities will allow me to dive deep into Jekyll. The more I can develop my skill of the liquid templating system as well as understanding the full capabilities of the site structure, the more I will gain a mastery over HTML, HTTP, CSS and so one. Even if I only build the basics, I still get access to increase my fundamental coding skills while retaining control over design and userflow.

## Flexible Build Process
The fact that Jekyll is a static site generator allows me to test different build techniques. Since there is no database to reference, I do not have to worry about keeping my data synced. This allows me to test all sorts of different build systems as long as the final result is a compilation of all my resources.
