Graphic Design is one of my passions. My fondness for Graphic Design has grown from my fondness for Fine Arts. Originally planning on working toward a Fine Arts degree, and potentially a career, life has thrown me through some events that saw to my plans being changed.<!-- more --> The more time I spend as a Graphic Designer, the more intrigued I am by the capabilities of visual communication. There are so many avenues through which we can communicate our message that it is easy to lose clerity and often too easy to lose sight of intent. Still, there are incredible examples out there of incredible design solutions that are not only inspiring, but also potentially timeless.

That being said, I have moved more and more into the digital realm. Originally as a means to build my personal portfolio site a few years back, the more I work in the digital design space, the more I enjoy the potential for growth. There are so many burgeoning technologies, it can be a bit overwhelming. Still, that is one of the main reasons I am looking forward to a purposeful shift in my focus from my current Graphic Design focus to that of a Front End Developer. Here's how I plan to make this transition.

## Step 1.
**Develop a list of skills to learn.**   
Mastery of all skills may not be in the cards for me at this time. Still, with the fluidity of technology and the inability to define project goals arbitrarily, it is difficult to nail down exactly what a 'Front End Developer' needs to be able to do. Even developing a strong set of core skills is rough when you don't know what people expect of you. 

After talking with a friend who was working as a Front End Dev., he offered me a link titled ['A Baseline for Front-End Developers'](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers). Though this article is currently a bit dated (written in Arpil 2012 and it's currently Februray 2016), it still offers me a ton of good information from which I can begin compiling a list. Even a simple search for 'Front End Developer skills' brings countless pages of people with opinions. [The top result at the time](http://learntocodewith.me/web-dev/front-end-developer-skills/) has a wealth of information, and though it is bursting with marketing links, the information is incredible. Laurence Bradford compiled some really good information gathered while comparing job postings, online course syllabi, and information from industry leaders, Laurence is able to compile real, useful information (as well as useful links, including the 'Baseline for Front-End Developers from above).

All in all, it is a bit daunting when you start gathering all the skills that are potentially 'required' to be a front end dev. Still, these resources offer me a great, um, baseline, to begin.

## Step 2.
**The no-questions-asked, absolute, must-have required skills.**   
HTML. CSS. JavaScript. These three, across the board I have seen to be absolutely required for any real chance at getting better at the web. Not only will not knowing these limit your creative capabilities by limiting what you put together within a site, not knowing these will limit your planning capabilities. Even if you go into UX/UI, web design, interface design, or all the varieties of making the web 'look good', you need to know *at least* the basics of how HTML and CSS function. Without this knowledge, you will never know just how far you can push designs.

That being said, when you have to implement this code to actually make something, knowing the fundamentals is absolutely key to being better. I have been using these languages for a while now, and although I am by no means a master of them, I am more than comfortable using them to create things.

**Learn these for sure. Use them all the time:**

* HTML/HTML 5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Responsive Design Best Practices
* Accessibility

## Step 3.
**The stuff people seem to know like it's old news.**   
Like I've said many, many times: Transitioning from design to front end dev. work can be daunting. There's not only so much to *learn*, there's also so much to *catch up on*. Understanding the basic tools for front end developers takes some time. Still, everywhere you look people seem to know them so well and have been using them for so long that they're not new. They're old. But to me, they're brand new.

It took me a while to understand that this group of people that know all these things so well aren't there as an ominous coalition of ne'er'do-wells, but as a resource. All of these people learned all of these technologies at one time or another. The best thing you can do is take advantage of the incredible community surrounding web development and accept that most everyone is willing to share their experiences. I have begun to realize that I do not need to learn in a vaccuum. I can take advantage of so many resources already put in place.

**Learn these and become comfortable enough to not screw anything up on a regular basis:**

* Git/GitHub
* PHP
* JSON
* AJAX
* Build Tools

## Step 4.
**All of these are useful and exciting.**   
Some new technologies seem more fun than others. I'm a very visual person so when I have to comb through databses, it's not always that exciting. But, when I can nest my CSS and easily implement changes through modular file structures, hit refresh (until I get better at [this](https://www.browsersync.io/). Looking forward to that!) and see all of my changes, it gets me pretty pumped. So, while reading through all the things, I began to realize that some of the technologies just sound more inherintly fun than others, so maybe I should prioritize some of those.

**I'm pretty jazzed about these:**

* Sass
* Ruby on Rails
* Jekyll
* Angular
* React
* Meteor

##Step 5.
**Accept that it's not all fun and games.**   
While the list above allows me to buidl some really cool stuff, there are technologies that I need to know if I want to be effective. And who knows, when I'm learning some of these, maybe I'll be as struck by them as I was by coding in the first place. I mean, to be honest, when I first set out to build my original portfolio site, I kind of wanted to tear my eyeballs out. Dreamweaver never seemed to do what I wanted it to and then I would pop into my file manager, copy over my files, and hit refresh. Everything looked so good! I went to show my friend my super cool new site, but he didn't have Chrome. When I pulled it up in Internet Explorer, I wanted to rip that monitor off his desk and throw it out the window.

When I copied those files into my iPage fila manager and popped that site up at home from a live URL, I felt immediate gratification. When I showed the same page to my friend later that day in Internet Explorer, I lost all gratification. I had no idea what vendor prefixing was. I had no idea browsers rendered elements differently and processed CSS differently. I nearly gave up. I was so exacerbated by the whole experience that I nearly gave up. Still, by learning some stuff that I really didn't want to learn, I was able to (mostly) fix my site and avoided most of those issues on the next one.

**Stuff I am not super pumped to learn but really want/need to know at least the basics:**

* Basic Server anything tech
* MySQL, SQLite
* Java Application Structures
* Basic System Admin

## Step 6.
**One of my biggest inspirations to date.**   
While driving to and from my old jobs, I would dream of making my way out of that field and into design and development. One of the bigget contributors to these dreams was the [ShopTalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/). I'm sure I'm not alone, it seems pretty popular. Still, all the guidance they offer in their episodes mirrored so well what I was reading, it sort of validated my original plan. So, with the biggest piece of advice they offer, I plan to 'Just Build Websites'.

I know you've heard it on there, and if you haven't, you should. It's an incredible show and they offer an incredible perspective on how I can transition from Designer to Developer. The message to just build something—anything at all really—to contribute and take part in the discussions. To test things and offer what you test. Even if you don't know what you're doing, at least you're doing something. Then, one day, by testing and playing around in the digital space, you will eventually find out that you maybe kind of know what you're doing. At least a little bit. But that's all it takes.

So, that's my plan. I probably won't follow these steps in order, but at least I have a quasi-list of things I would like to do. My plan is to play around with as many of these as I can throughout 2016 so that by the end of the year, I've at least spent some time on each one. Even if it's a few hours, I'll **build** something with each one. I won't just read about it. I'll actually build it.
